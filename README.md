# Music Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes a dataset of songs, visualizing key trends and insights using Python and Matplotlib.  The analysis includes:

## Features

* **Top 5 Most Streamed Songs:** A horizontal bar chart displaying the top 5 songs with the highest stream counts.
* **Genre Distribution:** A pie chart illustrating the distribution of different music genres within the dataset.
* **Top 10 Artists:** A horizontal bar chart showing the top 10 artists based on total streams.
* **Explicit Content Analysis:** A bar chart visualizing the proportion of songs with explicit content versus non-explicit content.


## Data

The project utilizes a CSV file named `songs.csv`.  Ensure this file is present in the same directory as the script.  This file is expected to have columns for:

* `song_id`
* `song_title`
* `stream`
* `genre`
* `artist`
* `explicit_content`


## Usage

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python 3
   - Required Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, numpy
   - Install libraries using pip: `pip install pandas matplotlib numpy`

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the python script.


3. **File Upload (Google Colab):**
   If running in Google Colaboratory, you'll need to upload the `songs.csv` file through the Colab interface when prompted.


## Example

The project generates several visualizations to show:

- The most popular songs based on streams.
- The distribution of songs across different genres.
- The most popular artists based on the total streams of their songs.
- The percentage of explicit content in the dataset.
